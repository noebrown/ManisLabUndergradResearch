AMPA_gmax and NMDA_gmax are the estimated average peak conductances (in nS) 
resulting from an action potential in a single auditory nerve terminal, under 
conditions that minimize the effects of short-term plasticity.
AMPA_gmax are from values measured at -65 mV (or -70mV), and represent SINGLE TERMINAL 
conductances
AMPAR_gmax are the individual synapse postsynaptic conductance
NMDA_gmax values are taken as the fraction of the current that is NMDAR dependent
at +40 mV (see below)

n_rsites is the number of release sites per SGC terminal.

[1] Derived from Cao, X. & Oertel, D. (2010). Single-terminal conductance was
    reported as 21.5±15.4 nS (1.4±1.0 nA at -65 mV). The ratio of NMDA current to 
    total current is 0.3, so AMPA and NMDA currents are:
       AMPA_gmax = 21.5±15.4 nS (measured at -65 mV)
       NMDA_gmax = 21.5±15.4 nS * 0.3 = 10.8±4.6 nS

[2] Derived from Cao, X. & Oertel, D. (2010). Single-terminal conductance was
    estimated as 4.6±3.1 nS. The ratio of NMDA current to 
    total current is 0.53, so AMPA and NMDA currents are:
       AMPA_gmax = 4.6±3.1 nS
       NMDA_gmax = 4.6±3.1 nS * 0.53 = 2.4±1.6 nS

[3] Derived from Cao, X. & Oertel, D. (2010). Single-terminal conductance was
    estimated as 52±14 nS / 60 = 0.87±0.23 nS. The ratio of NMDA current to 
    total current is 0.2, so AMPA and NMDA currents are:
       AMPA_gmax = 0.87±0.23 nS
       NMDA_gmax = 0.87±0.23 nS * 0.2 = 0.17±0.046 nS
    Age>p17, Temperature=33C, [Mg2+]=1.3mM, [Ca2+]=2.4mM

[6] A value of 45 would be chosen to satisfy the CV of EPSC amplitude determined in [9].
    However, those measures are for simultaneous stimulation of multiple AN fibers.

    Single terminal conductance = (1.2 ± 0.70 nA/70 mV)/ 35 inputs = 0.490 ± 0.286 nS
    (see connections.py) 
    Single terminal conductance from mini = 34 pA/70 mV = 0.486 nS (single mini)
    Assume same AMPA/NMDA ratio as tstellate cells, but measures made where NMDA = 0
    (at negative V):
       AMPA_gmax = 0.490±0.286 nS
       NMDA_gmax = 0.490±0.286 nS * 0.53/0.47 = 0.552±0.322 nS

[10]  Maximum AMPA open conductance per synaptic site (units are pS). 
      These values are calculated by running python cnmodel/synapses/tests/test_psd.py
      for a specific cell type (if the cell uses the receptor mechanisms; this is 
      not necessary for simple exp2syn style mechanisms)
      to ensure that maximum AMPA conductance during PSG matches [1, 2 or 3]
      For a bushy cell, the original default values  (bushy cell) were:
          AMPAR_gmax   3.314707700918133
          NMDAR_gmax   0.4531929783503451
      These values will also depend on the number of release sites per
      synapse (the total conductance is produce of site gmax and nsites).
      
      A note on the precision of these values: This precision is only
      required for the tests of the model, as a way of ensuring numerical
      equivalency after potential modifications of the code. The precision
      of the value is in no way intended to specificy biological precision.

      For example, a change in the rate constants in the AMPA_Trussell AMPA
      receptor model could (and probably would) change the open probability,
      and therefore the maximal conductance of an EPSC. However, as this is
      only a representation of the EPSC, the "receptor" conductance should
      be scaled so that the computed EPSC has the same maximal conductance
      as prior to the kinetic modifications. Because the receptor model is
      numerically computed (and not analytically tractable without
      additional knowledge of the ligand time course), a numerical solution
      is required.

[11]  Pr is the initial release probability. The value can be computed by
      setting Pr to 1 in this file, and running the cnmodel test_synapses.py
      with the appropriate presynaptic source and postsynaptic target,
      once all other parameters are set. The Pr is used to rescale
      the AMPAR_gmax so that the total current matches the data in 
      AMPA_gmax in the table (on average).

[12]  NMDA_vshift is the voltage shift for the activation of the NMDAR's, relative
      to 0 (standard in the NMDA_Kampa model). A negative value shifts the voltage
      dependence to the right (depolarizing).
      The value of the shift (0 or -15 mV) was chosen based on an exploration
      of fitting functions against the NMDA-Kampa IV curve in an SGC-bushy cell
      model, and comparing them against data. The functions were the modified
      Woodhull function and a Boltzmann function, yielding values of 1.19 mM for 
      k0 and 0.78 for delta (tau decay at +40 mV of 16.4 ms), and Vr -3 mV, Vh
      16 mV for the Boltzmann fit. These are close to the values reported in 
      for NMDA currents in p14-p26 CBA/CaJ mice in Pliss et al. (J. Neurophys. 
      102, 2627, 2009). Note: Pliss et al. agree with Cao and Oertel regarding
      an approximate 10-fold difference between AMPA and NMDA conductance in
      mouse bushy cells. An exact fit was not obtained, but no other parameters
      of the NMDA_Kampa model were changed. 
      ***
      Removed the follwing line 4/30/2019, as it was confusing.
      These were the -15 mV shifts. They cause the sgc->busy psd (for example) to fail, 
      because that was computed with a 0 mV scaling.

AMPA receptor kinetic values obtained by fitting the model of Raman and 
Trussell (1992) to measured EPSCs in the mouse VCN.

Ro1, Ro2, Rc1, Rc2, and PA are kinetic constants affecting the AMPA receptor
mechanism. tau_g and A affect the speed and amplitude of transmitter release
(implemented in the presynaptic release mechanism).
These parameters were selected to fit the model output to known EPSC shapes.

PA is a polyamine block parameter ued in the AMPAR mechanism (concentration in micromolar).

    and pyramidal cells are fast, with a decay time constant similar to that seen in tstellate
    cells). In pyramidal cells, this is consistent with the brief cross-correlation tip (Voigt
    and Young, 1980) and brief somatic current source (Manis and Brownell, 1983).

AMPA_gmax and NMDA_gmax are the estimated average peak conductances (in nS) 
resulting from an action potential in a single presynaptic terminal under 
conditions that minimize the effects of short-term plasticity.
AMPA_gmax are from values measured at -65 mV (or -70mV), and represent SINGLE TERMINAL 
conductances
AMPAR_gmax are the individual synapse postsynaptic conductance
NMDA_gmax values are taken as the fraction of the current that is NMDAR dependent
at +40 mV (see below)

n_rsites is the number of release sites per terminal.
